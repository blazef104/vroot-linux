# vroot-linux
Docker template files for IMUNES virtual nodes

This image is based on [Phusion](http://www.phusion.nl/) baseimage-docker and slightly modified to run a different distro version along with some new packages.

You can use it as a base for your own Docker images. For more info on this
please check the [basedocker-image](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker) README or the source code.

*This image is modified to have a working instance of snort inside imunes. Use to command __ldconfig__ on the machine before launching snort.*
